# spring-boot-microservices
This project will simulate microservice architecture using Spring boot.

First we will start with creating 2 rest APIs using Spring boot i.e. order service and product service.
We will register these services to a Service discovery server which we will create using Spring netflix eureka server.
Next we will upload all our common configs to a config server to manage changing configs.
